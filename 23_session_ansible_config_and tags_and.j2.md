The `ansible.cfg` file is the configuration file for Ansible, which defines various settings and parameters for your Ansible environment. The configuration can be established in several locations, with the following hierarchy:

1. **ANSIBLE_CONFIG**: This is an environment variable that, if set, specifies the path to the Ansible configuration file. It takes precedence over other configuration files.

2. **ansible.cfg in the current directory**: If no environment variable is set, Ansible will look for the `ansible.cfg` file in the current working directory where the Ansible command is executed.

3. **~/.ansible.cfg**: If a configuration file is not found in the current directory, Ansible will then check for the `ansible.cfg` file in the user's home directory (referred to as the "tilde" or `~`).

4. **/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg**: Finally, if none of the above configuration files are found, Ansible will default to the system-wide configuration file located at `/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg`.

This order of precedence means that the configuration file found in the current directory will override the one in the home directory, and the home directory configuration will override the system-wide configuration.

To set up your Ansible configuration, first, create a file named `ansible.cfg` in the current directory. Within this file, include the following lines under the `[defaults]` section:

```
[defaults]
inventory=inventory.ini
ansible_user=centos
```

Next, create an `inventory.ini` file, where you will specify the variables for all hosts. Within this file, add the following lines to define the Ansible password:

```
[all:vars]
ansible_password=DevOps321
```

This setup allows you to define the inventory and user details required for your Ansible automation tasks.
