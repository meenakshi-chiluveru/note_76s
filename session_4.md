**Comprehensive Guide to Service Management**

In the realm of computer systems, effective service management is vital for maintaining operational efficiency and ensuring the security of services. Each computer system is equipped with multiple network ports, each designated for specific functions. Understanding these ports is crucial for managing services effectively. Below are key ports along with the services typically associated with them:

- **SSH (Secure Shell):** This protocol operates on port 22 and is widely utilized for secure remote access to servers and network devices.
- **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol):** This is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web and operates on port 80, allowing users to access web pages.
- **HTTPS (HTTP Secure):** Utilizing port 443, HTTPS provides a secure channel over an insecure network, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of data exchanged between clients and servers.
- **MySQL:** This popular relational database management system communicates over port 3306, enabling applications to interact with database data securely and efficiently.
- **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol):** Functioning on port 25, SMTP is essential for sending email messages between servers.
- **DNS (Domain Name System):** Operating on port 53, DNS translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses, facilitating easier navigation on the internet.

To adequately manage these services, the initial step involves connecting to the desired IP address to determine which ports are active. This can be achieved through various network scanning tools. Identifying active services provides insights into the system's current operational state. Following this discovery phase, appropriate authentication measures should be employed to secure access to the system.

Focusing specifically on NGINX, a widely utilized web server known for its performance and resource efficiency, several commands are integral to its effective management:

1. **Starting NGINX:** To initiate the NGINX service, the following command is executed:  
   `systemctl start nginx`  
   This command activates the NGINX process, allowing it to handle incoming web requests.

2. **Checking NGINX Status:** To assess whether the NGINX service is currently running, the command utilized is:  
   `systemctl status nginx`  
   This command provides detailed information, including the service's active state and any potential error messages.

3. **Stopping NGINX:** Should there be a need to halt all operations of the NGINX service, the command is:  
   `systemctl stop nginx`  
   This command effectively terminates the service, making it no longer accessible to clients until restarted.

4. **Enabling NGINX for Automatic Start:** To ensure that the NGINX service automatically initiates following a system reboot, the command is:  
   `systemctl enable nginx`  
   This command sets the necessary configurations to enable the service to start without manual intervention.

5. **Disabling Automatic Start of NGINX:** Conversely, if it is necessary to prevent the NGINX service from launching automatically upon system start, the command is:  
   `systemctl disable nginx`  
   This action alters the service's startup configuration, ensuring it requires manual starting post-reboot.

A comprehensive understanding of these commands, in conjunction with effective port management practices, is essential for ensuring high availability, performance, and security of services within any computer system or network environment.
